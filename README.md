# Backend Developer Assessment

We are hiring a lot of excellent people at Lanxess. And it is often a challenge to set up an interview, since our managers might have quite busy schedules. So we’d like to ask you to build a prototype of an app that makes this process a little bit easier.

Build a bundle of REST interfaces (only apis are asked, no visual interfaces are needed) that allow to do the following:
a. Manage a list of employees who are making the interviews
b. Manage a list of potential candidates
c. Submit availability for the employee/candidate for the next week (that means, the list of
days of the week / hours available for the interview). For simplicity, we assume that we always deal with one specific week only (in other words, on Friday evening the assistant is making plans for the coming week). But you’re welcome to extend the task!
d. Receive a list of time slots to make an interview (providing a candidate and list of interviewers required). If there is no time slot available during next week, the service should return an appropriate error.
e.
You are welcome to use any additional frameworks you wish. And please do not hesitate to ask if something in the task looks unclear to you. Have fun!
